# BPMN Flow / SimpleFlow #

PHP Finite state machine efficient implementation based upon an incomplete
version of the BPMN specification.

The primary goal of this API is to give a simple and fast implementation of
finite state machine, and eventually of more complex business processes in
order to implement such things as business objects workflow in various
business software by providing strict invalid objects state change error control
during runtime in order to avoid pragmatic errors and saved data inconsitency.

## Installation ##

This library requires PHP 5.3 or higher. This code is PSR-0 code and in order to
use it, you have to provide your own PSR-0 autoloader.

Here is a two step installation:

 * Download it somewhere

 * Register it to your PSR-0 autoloader, if you don't have such thing, you can
   use this non-efficient code:

``` php
spl_autoload_register(function ($classname) {
    $parts = explode('\\', $classname);
    if ('BpmnFlow' === $parts[0] || 'SimpleFlow' === $parts[0]) {
        $filename = 'PUT HERE THE LIBRARY PATH' . implode('/', $parts) . '.php';
        if (file_exists($filename)) {
            require_once $filename;
            return TRUE;
        }
    }
    return FALSE;
});
```

## Disclaimer ##

The goal may be ambitious, this is not guaranted it will reach it, this is at
this very moment purely educational code and it does not ambition to be used by
concrete or business software. 

This is not supposed to become complete anytime, except if people are interested
to do so. BPMN complete specification implementation is not a goal, only
semantics and object naming are actually in use in this code.
